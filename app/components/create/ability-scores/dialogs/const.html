        <h2>Constitution</h2>
        <p>
          Constitution represents your character's health and stamina. A Constitution bonus increases a character's hit points, so the ability is important for all classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          You apply your character's Constitution modifier to:
        <ul>
            <li>Each roll of a Hit Die (though a penalty can never drop a result below 1â€”that is, a character always gains at least 1 hit point each time he advances in level).</li>
            <li>Fortitude saving throws, for resisting poison, disease, and similar threats.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h2>Dexterity</h2>
        <p>
          Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance. This ability is the most important one for rogues, but it's also useful for characters who wear light or medium armor or no armor at all. This ability is vital for characters seeking to excel with ranged weapons, such as the bow or sling.
        <p>
          You apply your character's Dexterity modifier to:
        <ul>
            <li>Ranged attack rolls, including those for attacks made with bows, crossbows, throwing axes, and many ranged spell attacks like scorching ray or searing light.</li>
            <li>Armor Class (AC), provided that the character can react to the attack.</li>
            <li>Reflex saving throws, for avoiding fireballs and other attacks that you can escape by moving quickly.</li>
            <li>Acrobatics, Disable Device, Escape Artist, Fly, Ride, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
          Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. This ability is important for wizards because it affects their spellcasting ability in many ways. Creatures of animal-level instinct have Intelligence scores of 1 or 2. Any creature capable of understanding speech has a score of at least 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          You apply your character's Intelligence modifier to:
        <ul>
            <li>The number of bonus languages your character knows at the start of the game. These are in addition to any starting racial languages and Common. If you have a penalty, you can still read and speak your racial languages unless your Intelligence is lower than 3.</li>
            <li>The number of skill points gained each level, though your character always gets at least 1 skill point per level.</li>
            <li>Appraise, Craft, Knowledge, Linguistics, and Spellcraft checks.</li>
        </ul>

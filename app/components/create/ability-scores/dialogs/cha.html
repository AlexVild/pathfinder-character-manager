        <h2>Charisma</h2>
        <p>
          Charisma measures a character's personality, personal magnetism, ability to lead, and appearance. It is the most important ability for paladins, sorcerers, and bards. It is also important for clerics, since it affects their ability to channel energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          You apply your character's Charisma modifier to:
        <ul>
            <li>Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Handle Animal, Intimidate, Perform, and Use Magic Device checks.</li>
            <li>Checks that represent attempts to influence others.</li>
            <li>Channel energy DCs for clerics and paladins attempting to harm undead foes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Wisdom</h2>
        <p>
          Wisdom describes a character's willpower, common sense, awareness, and intuition. Wisdom is the most important ability for clerics and druids, and it is also important for monks and rangers. If you want your character to have acute senses, put a high score in Wisdom.
        </p>

          You apply your character's Wisdom modifier to:
        <ul>
            <li>Will saving throws (for negating the effects of charm person and other spells).</li>
            <li>Heal, Perception, Profession, Sense Motive, and Survival checks.</li>
        </ul>

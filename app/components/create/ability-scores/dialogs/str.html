        <h2>Strength</h2>
        <p>
          Strength measures muscle and physical power. This ability is important for those who engage in hand-to-hand (or “melee”) combat, such as fighters, monks, paladins, and some rangers. Strength also sets the maximum amount of weight your character can carry.
        </p>
        <p>
          You apply your character's Strength modifier to:
        <ul>
            <li>Melee attack rolls.</li>
            <li>Damage rolls when using a melee weapon or a thrown weapon, including a sling</li>
            <li>Climb and Swim checks.</li>
            <li>Strength checks (for breaking down doors and the like).</li>
        </ul>
